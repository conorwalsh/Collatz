# Collatz Conjecture
This PHP code calculates the number of steps it takes to perform the Collatz conjecture on a number. The Collatz conjecture is when you take any natural number greater than 1 and if n is even, divide it by 2 or if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. These steps are repeated until 1 is found.
