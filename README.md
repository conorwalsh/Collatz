# Collatz Conjecture
This PHP code calculates the number of steps it takes to perform the Collatz conjecture on a number. The Collatz conjecture is when you take any natural number greater than 1 and if n is even, divide it by 2 or if n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1. These steps are repeated until 1 is found.

You can see this code in action <a href="http://www.conorwalsh.net/algorithms/collatz/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Thank you for taking the time to look at this project I hope that it is of use to you,<br/>
